# webR-quarto-demos

This repository houses experiments with generating a standalone [Quarto Document](https://quarto.org/) using [WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/).

- [Quarto HTML Document with WebR]()
- [Quarto RevealJS Lecture Slides with WebR]()

## Background

[WebR v0.1.0](https://twitter.com/gwstagg/status/1633821049329537025) was launched on March 9th
by George Stagg ([georgestagg](https://github.com/georgestagg)) and Lionel Henry ([lionel-](https://github.com/lionel-)). The goal of webR is to: 

> to run R code in the browser without the need for an R server to execute the code

This is _amazing_ advancement of _R_ and has major implications with teaching R to the masses!
